# Color Chests Mod
#### Craft colorized versions of chests for organization.

All required pigments are based around the "color" of the item you might have. For example, If you want a purple chest, find something that has purple in it.

I will be expanding this into a pigment/dye system in the future. Allowing the ability to dye armor, etc.
